# Arduino Miscellaneous

Welcome to my collection of code for different arduino projects I have worked on. The repository serves as a way to store my work and hopefully serve as a guide for you to make your own.

> ⚠️ Warning: The codes were developed based on my specific needs, they may not meet yours, just take them as a guide. Use at your own risk.

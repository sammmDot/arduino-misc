# Explain

A soil moisture sensor is used to obtain information on conductivity, temperature and soil moisture. It includes an .ino code needed to use the sensor which uses a RS485 protocol. The use is exemplified using python afterwards and a dataframe is made using **pandas**, plotted with the **mathplotlib** library and **seaborn**.
